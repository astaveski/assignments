HW #1 -- Part II -- Question #8

I filtered the ProPublica dataset to include only rows with a stated 'PURPOSE' of 'Food & Beverage' and a 'VALUE' of over $100. I learned that the three offices that spend the most money on food and beverages are the Office of the Speaker, the Republican Conference, and the Office of the Minority Leader. Representative Karen Bass is the least frugal congressperson, having spent over $100 on food on 14 separate occasions during the first quarter of 2017. There was less satisfying information on where the food was purchased--The Boise Cascade Company (a shipping and distribution organization) was billed more than any other seller. However, among relevant purveyors, First Choice Coffee Services and Aramark Refreshment Services were the most likely to be billed. Across all purveyors (including only those purchases over $100), the mean purchase was $576 and the median purchase was $204.
